    "To analyze public sentiment toward EV charging stations in Delhi-NCR using Twitter-style social media data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simulated a Twitter dataset of 20 tweets with real-world tone and concerns\n",
    "- Cleaned the text using `nltk` (stopwords, punctuation, etc.)\n",
    "- Used VADER from `vaderSentiment` to classify sentiment\n",
    "- Visualized tweet sentiment distribution and frequency of complaints\n",
    "- WordClouds and bigrams were used to detect repeating themes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools Used\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK, WordCloud\n",
    "- VADER for sentiment classification\n",
    "\n",
    "## Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- Positive tweets highlight efficient stations at IGI Airport, CP, and Vasant Kunj\n",
    "- Most negative tweets were from Noida and Gurgaon due to offline or broken chargers\n",
    "- WordClouds and bigrams showed common frustrations like \"station offline\", \"long wait\", etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improve charger uptime in high-demand areas\n",
    "- Add signage and station availability updates on apps\n",
    "- Expand coverage in East Delhi and Noida sectors\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project shows how sentiment analysis on social platforms can inform urban infrastructure improvements and citizen satisfaction.\n"
